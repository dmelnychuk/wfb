          <p>
            We work with businesses of all sizes, from startups to enterprise companies. Our automation solutions are particularly beneficial for 
            service-based businesses, e-commerce companies, and any organization with repetitive manual processes.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How long does it take to implement workflow automation?</h3>
          <p>
            Implementation timelines vary based on complexity, but most projects are completed within 2-6 weeks. Simple automations can be 
            set up in a few days, while comprehensive CRM setups may take several weeks to ensure everything is properly configured and tested.
