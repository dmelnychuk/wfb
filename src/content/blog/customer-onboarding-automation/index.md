## Why Customer Onboarding Automation Matters

Manual onboarding is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to delays that frustrate new customers. Automation transforms this critical process into a seamless experience that delights customers while saving your team countless hours.

## The Cost of Poor Onboarding

### What Happens Without Proper Onboarding
- **67% of customers** churn within the first 90 days due to poor onboarding
- **Average 23% revenue loss** from customers who don't complete onboarding
- **3-5 hours per customer** spent on manual onboarding tasks
- **Inconsistent experiences** that damage brand reputation

### Common Onboarding Pain Points
- Delayed welcome communications
- Missing or incomplete account setup
- Unclear next steps for customers
- Manual data entry errors
